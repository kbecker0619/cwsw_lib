# NOTE:
# within the Doxy system, all relative directories, are relative to the location of the

# a project-specific Doxyfile, it is almost guaranteed that the directories identified
# below will be wrong. Therefore, we list here the directories that top-level doxyfile 
# will need to specify. Consider this to be a reference.
