# ==================================

# Note for each section below:
# the "STRIP_FROM_PATH" configuration is a PROJECT-SPECIFIC formatting option that applies to
#	includes and included-by graphs. this is necessarily a project-specific configuration:
#	we want "DIRECTORY_GRAPH" to be enabled, so that we can see a graph for folder relationships
#	if we disable "DIRECTORY_GRAPH", the File List section of the menu pane lists only files - no
#	directories are shown.
#	by specifying the appropriate paths here, we can strip the "noise" introduced by the paths
#	from the includes and included-by graphs.

# ==================================

# specify front page for Doxy output
#	note this makes another assumption about this file's location in the project tree
